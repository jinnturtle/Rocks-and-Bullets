* Text Rendering From Font Atlas
- TODO: Why on this dear Earth of God offsetting something by 3x10 offsets it by
  3x7, while offsetting it by 3x8, offsets it by 3x5 but upside down? Make it
  make sense.
- TODO: Grab texture dimensions to set size of quads etc, so I don't have to do
  it manually once I'll start playing around with the dimensions of the font
  atlas.
- TODO: Maybe it's a good time to start encapsulating some of the render
  settings and data e.g. ~shader_id~, ~glPolygonMode~, draw mode for
  ~glDrawArrays~ are usually linked to the object drawn.
