* GFX Technologies
- Textures :: KTX2. PNG should work well as source in all (or most cases), easy
  to work with in regards to the tools I'd like to use.

* To-Do List
(Just noting things that come to mind at the moment, not exhaustive or ordered
etc.)

- [X] Find screen width and length at a given distance from camera.
- [X] Find size of one pixel.
- [ ] Make tile grid of quads, ability to toggle overlay of bordered
  squares. The overlay will be used for debug (e.g. quad or other object
  alignment) now and grid view (for visibility) can be based of this tech
  later.
- [ ] Frame sleep based on actual tracked frame-time.
- [ ] Encapsulate scene objects and move out of 'main()'.
- [ ] Clean up rendering loop (i.e. functionise etc.).
- [-] Font rendering:
  - [X] Decide if using vertex (line-based) text or rasterised textures
   (prob. pre-rendered and loaded).
    - Decision: pre-rendered font map, PNG.
  - [X] Write a texture loader
    - +[ ] PNG -> KTX2 Converter / wrapper.+
    - [X] See KTX2 lib, has official utilities for making KTX2 data.
  - [ ] Write utility that can actually assemble the font-atlas texture bits
    into a text texture.

* Stretch and Fun Goals
- [X] See if storing textures as KTX2 (instead of PNG) takes less space on disk, if
  so: don't distribute PNGs, but convert to platform-appropriate format and pack
  into KTX2 before shipping the executable.
  - Yep, KTX2 can be smaller if stored with no mipmaps. (UASTC compressed with
    zstd 20+).
